## Business Activities

* Meta is very ambitious and hopes to have their consumer base be as wide as possible spanning the entire internet. They want to bring the metaverse to the world as a whole.

* Meta's solution to their problem defined as making sure everyone is connected and able to communicate is the metaverse. This is a sort of huge social network that users can access to connect and socialize with other users.

* Just Facebook alone uses 
**React, PHP, GraphQL, Memcached, Cassandra, Hack, Flux, Tornado, Presto, Relay Framework, RocksDB, Yoga, Prepack, McRouter, Hydra Framework, Beringei, Framer, Docusaurus, BitBar, Prophet, Origami, Stetho, Pop, ENorm, Jenkins, Jest, Datadog, Chef, Phabricator, HHVM, Nuclide, Buck, Infer, LogDevice, Confluence and Campaign Monitor.**

## Landscape

* Meta experiements and develops with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).

* Aside from greatly improving the standard functions of virtual reality headsets and things similar to the google glasses, there have been many innovations. Meta released the Meta Quest 3, a wireless virutal reality headset with augmented reality support. Allowing seamless transition between virutal and augmented reality experiences.

* Valve is the biggest competitor to Meta's VR and AR technology. There are smaller, less signifigant competitors but they don't pose any competition.

## Results

* Meta has become one of the leading companies in A.I., VR/AR, and social networking technology.

* Meta most likely measures their success on their profit and customer numbers.

* Meta is leading, if not, close to leading against it's competitors.

## Recommendations

* Instead of including VR and AR in the same device, it would be interesting to see how an extremely lightweight version of a VR headset or "glasses" would do. The same goes for AR headsets or "glasses".

* Providing these devices with specific functionality could offer the company a place to focus and experiment on ideas solely in that field. It would also allow customers to "buy a tool that's really good at it's job."

* It would not utilize any new technology in my suggestion, but it is expandable for whatever Meta wants to do.
